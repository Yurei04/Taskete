# Taskete: Dispatch and Respond

Taskete is a web application designed to bridge the gap between emergency dispatchers and responders, enabling efficient communication and coordination during critical situations.

---

## 🌟 Inspiration
This project draws its inspiration from the anime *86*, specifically the Handler One system that oversees both Emergency Dispatch Conversation (EDC) and Micro Credentialing System for Medicine (MCSM). The design focuses on dual functionality for dispatchers and responders, driven by lateral challenges and ideas shared by organizers.
